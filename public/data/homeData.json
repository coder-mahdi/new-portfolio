  "about":{
    "title": "About Me",
    "More Than Just Code": "The code I write today is shaped by a background in journalism, communication, and real-world experiences across cultures. For years, I told stories, taught, and developed strategies in political and commercial spaces — all while exploring life across Africa, Europe, and Asia. This journey has shaped how I think about design, storytelling, and the user experience. To me, good code is more than just function — it’s about feeling, clarity, and connection. Now, I bring that blend of logic, empathy, and creativity into every line I write.",
    "What Drives Me": "I’m driven by the need to give my best  always. When I take on a project, I go all in: starting early, staying late, and making sure every detail gets the attention it deserves. I believe that if something doesn’t work out, it should never be because of a lack of effort. I’m motivated by creativity, variety, and progress. Repetition bores me. I constantly look for smarter, better, more meaningful ways to do things. Growth, both personal and professional, is what keeps me moving."
