    "myStory": "I was born and raised in a small town in western Iran and spent over a decade in Tehran before embarking on years of travel across East Africa and other parts of the world. My journey led me to write a book in Persian about my travel experiences and personal reflections.With a background in media and communications, I worked as a journalist, editor, and university lecturer, focusing on the social impact of technology and media. This perspective now complements my work as a web developer.Since moving to Vancouver, Canada, I’ve been working in the tech industry with a focus on frontend development and digital communication. I build websites from both a technical and strategic standpoint — combining visual design, user experience, and content thinking.",
    "hobbies": "I’m passionate about nature and outdoor adventures. I love camping and backcountry hiking, and I often spend weekends exploring the wilderness. I also enjoy kayaking and sailing during the warmer seasons, and in the winter, I stay active through skiing in the mountains. Adventure and connection with nature are essential parts of my life.",
